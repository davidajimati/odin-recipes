    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, coated in a <br>
        cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, the street food was likely <br>
        invented by German immigrants in Texas in the 1920s.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this homemade corn dog recipe:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Cornmeal</b> and <b>flour:</b> This corn dog batter starts with yellow cornmeal and all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar:</b> A pinch of sugar lends a hint of sweetness.</li>
        <li><b>Baking powder:</b> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
        <li><b>Salt </b>and <b>pepper:</b> Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><b>Milk: </b>A cup of milk adds moisture, ensuring a tender coating.</li>
        <li><b>Egg: </b>An egg gives the batter even more moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.</li>
        <li><b>Oil: </b>Fry the corn dogs in a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil.</li>
        <li><b>Beef frankfurters: </b>This recipe calls for beef frankfurters, but you can use pork franks (or hot dogs) if you'd prefer.</li>
    </ul>
